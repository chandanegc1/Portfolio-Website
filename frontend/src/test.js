        description: "Living at home. Coming back home. Feeling at home. There's no place like home. These expressions are often heard, said, and felt without noticing the strength and importance of the word HOME: the magnitude of the space, the responsibility it carries, and the affection it generates. Our project does nothing but pursue the idea of turning a building into a home. Located in Villa Carlos Paz, a hilly city in the province of Córdoba, surrounded by nature with its rivers, and lake, constantly accompanied by hills that guard the urban area. Here is where our project was born, a building of residential units within a neighborhood adjacent to the city center, which keeps it away from the hustle of tourism and at the same time within an urbanized natural environment. Structured around three blocks built around a central core that dematerializes common circulation, turning stairs and corridors simply into sidewalks, courtyards, and public space, through the development of a brick metal walkway, accompanying the visual rhythm of the corridors. The large and ventilated void becomes an element of climate control, visuals, lights and shadows, encounters, permanence, and tradition. The exterior reminds us of the interior. Spacious, well-ventilated, and illuminated spaces are achieved thanks to a balanced use of environmental resources. The materiality accompanies the site of implantation, relates to the context, and seeks to provide sensory value with textures, organic colors, and imperfect and irregular forms, creating simple atmospheres that go with living at HOME. Flia was designed thinking of conscious spaces, their details, and their functionality. It is a building composed of the sum of 12 houses, with patios, a square, and a parking garage. Flia is a strong concept that deals with good living, sharing, conscious dwelling, recognizing oneself with the environment, integrating with it, and being part of it. We live in society sharing with others and with ourselves: we live in Flia.",

        description: "On this humble inter-terrace site of under 1400sqft, the architects have managed to create a sensation of surprising openness and limitless space within a lush green environment, while still very comfortably accommodating all the necessary functions of a home. Situated within the narrow streets and densely packed rows of terrace houses of Opera Estate, it is difficult to imagine that such an open and well-ventilated house could be achievable. But through clever design and the immersion of natural greenery throughout both the internal and external spaces of the house, the feeling within the home is one of being encompassed by a boundless garden, with a gentle, constant breeze. To achieve this sense of spaciousness, the architects have tucked all the main service areas of the home away into a part basement, leaving the ground floor as a vast open space with a central courtyard. In this triple volume courtyard grows a leafy ficus tree within a bubbling water feature, bathed in gentle sunlight from the skylight above. The center of the home, which is in many inter-terrace houses a dark and uncomfortable space, is here transformed into a lush internal garden. The front and the back facades of the 1st storey living spaces have been opened up to the maximum, using transparent roller shutters that can be hidden in the ceiling, allowing the prevailing winds to flow through the house. Surrounding this main living area are two external gardens at the front and back of the house. The front garden is a quaint chill-out space planted atop the car porch roof, creating a sensuous green backdrop for living room. The rear of the house has a small swimming pool directly outside the dining area that is nestled next to a textural boundary wall embedded with plants and ventilation blocks. These gardens and courtyard spaces of the home allow the occupants to feel the movement of the natural light across the house throughout the day, while shading them from its harsh impact. Several levels of tiered opened spaces can be seen while looking through the central courtyard - each planted with trees and creepers that lead the eye through the house, enhancing the views of the various spaces and greenery, and into the blue skies beyond.",

        description: "Representing 32% of the global population, Generation Z (those born between 1995 – 2010) accounts for a healthy chunk of the workforce (27% by 2025 and rising every year). These are the fresh young minds employers are fighting to attract. With prospective employers’ impact on society (93%) and a healthy work/life balance (77%) the two biggest motivators in deciding where Gen Z’ers want to work, a large part of any new office building’s design brief is green space. While hybrid working and flexible hours represent the most obvious ways to improve work/life balance for many, because of the missed social interactions and the lack of space or functionality at unproductive home workspaces, the majority of 16-24-year-olds are the only age group who prefer to work from the office. Architecture has always played a key role in providing shelter and protection for human beings. In prehistoric times, we sought refuge in caves, taking advantage of rock structures for protection against the natural elements and predators. Over time, shelters began to be made from materials found in nature, such as branches, leaves, and animal skins, evolving into more permanent and complex homes, with walls made of stone, bricks or wood, roofs to protect against rain and sun, and doors to control access. As we developed more advanced building skills, we used materials such as wood, stone, and clay and architecture evolved significantly, with the construction of temples, palaces, and fortifications that provided not only shelter but also symbolized power, status, and cultural identity. Even so, our buildings can continue to be seen as shells that protect us from the outside world. From the massive stones of Greek temples to glazed skyscrapers, we work with a range of possibilities and thicknesses to separate what we consider internal and external. This article seeks to explore this diversity of thicknesses in architecture, from simple materials to complex construction techniques, highlighting how this variation not only provides protection but also influences our perception and interaction with the built environment.",

The general objective is not to impose the face of the new, but to reveal in a new way what is already there, through articulations, spatial dispositions and new paths that the interventions discreetly provide. The emphasis of the new elements does not reside in their appearance, but in their performance, in what they are capable of promoting, in their effectiveness in dynamizing and enhancing the virtues of the preexisting ones. The first action plan focuses on works to recover the physical integrity and rehabilitation/modernization of the existing building, as well as the creation of a new, complementary and integrated sector, containing most of the services and areas necessary for the full functioning of a contemporary museum. We sought to conceive this expansion not as an annex or appendix, but as an underground extension of the pre-existing building which, in turn, contains most of the services and areas necessary for the full functioning of a contemporary museum."
